### Add Login Item

> Make it open automatically when you log in, it's handy to do using command line

```powershell
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to make login item at end with properties {path:"/Applications/MiddleClick.app", hidden:true}'
```

### Hide Status Bar Item

1. Holding <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>, drag it away from the status bar until you see a cross icon
2. Let it go

> To recover the item, just open MiddleClick when it's already running

##### This fork differs from the base fork in some ways which are listed below:

- Configuration: Click or Tap
  - preferred setting is saved for every user
- Removed old 32-bit/PowerPc `relaunch` binary due to it's incompatibility with macOS 10.15 Catalina and greater. Replaced with inline restarting of the app
- The App will not only restart on waking the Mac, but when a new touch device is added (so it immediately gains middleclicking ability) and when a display is added/reconfigured (which seems to be necessary)

#### Attention! Make sure to:

1. Quit an old version of MiddleClick
2. Remove it from the privacy settings
3. Enable the new version in privacy settings when prompted

> It is important to follow the steps in order, otherwise the Mouse may not be clickable and you have to `killall MiddleClick` via terminal or even force reset the Mac.
