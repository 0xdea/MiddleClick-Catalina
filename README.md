# MiddleClick

Emulate a middleclick with triple click on a Magic Mouse. Use private osx api for using the [macbook multitouch trackpad code](http://www.steike.com/code/multitouch/) and some [middleclick code](http://www.r0ssar00.com/2008/12/middle-click-on-mac-code.html).

# IMPORTANT

When coming from an older version of MiddleClick you have to remove MiddleClick from the accessibility settings and start the App again to readd it to the accessibility settings.
